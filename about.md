      <h3>What does mochilla and our logo mean?</h3>
      <p>Mochila means backpack in Spanish or Portuguese. It is derived from mochil meaning messenger/carrier. Every traveler is a messenger and story teller that uses a backpack on their journey. 

The white zipper allows us to zip and unzip our experiences. We travel to learn and make new experiences that we store as memories to later share with friends and families. 

Motto 
#Justpackup&go 

Don’t stop at planning. Take that leap of faith, and just pack up & go chase your dreams.

‘’Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets my soul on fire.’’- Unknown

      <h4>Meet Us</h4>
      <p>We met in 2013 at Cornell University, New York while we were completing our undergraduate studies.  We bonded around our passions for traveling and entrepreneurship. Combining our interests, we launched mochilla adventures in September 2016 and began travelling around SouthEast Asia. Our personal goals are to make a difference and travel around all 198 countries in the world. We love being inspired by other travelers and taking on new challenges. We have learnt a lot about ourselves and the world through our travels and we hope that by sharing our stories, we can help/inspire others to justpackup and pursue their dreams/journeys. </p>
