Mochilla Website 
================

Hey Aiden, I wasn't able to push to other branch because it was protected so I just put stuff on
this. And I figure its better to start from a clean slate.  I'm going to write out tasks and stuff
in the list below and we can work together on completing them. I'm going to put mockups I make in
a folder called "design" so we have them as reference Also, if you have any private repositories available, can
you make this one private?

1. If you want to claim a task, maybe add your name next to it like so? **Sachin**
1. ~~And once you finish a task, just cross it out.~~

Tasks

1.  Copy template off of this site [magnetic](https://pixelarity.com/magnetic).
    - I found this template that fits the Mochilla aesthetic very closely. We should buy it
      eventually, but for now, let's grab from the code from their demo site.
2.  Split up template into smaller files for Jeyll
    - you've seen how jekyll works
3.  Recreate website layout from other website
    - use Bryan's image for now, I can make something a little more concrete if needed
4.  Connect with Google Drive so that others can edit content
5.  Add website text content
6.  Create custom interactive blog/gallery based on designs
7.  Set up pipeline for new images, videos and blog content
7.  ???
8.  Profit
