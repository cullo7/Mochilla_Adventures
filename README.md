Mochilla Website 
================

Hey Aiden, I wasn't able to push to other branch because it was protected so I just put stuff on
this. And I figure its better to start from a clean slate.  I'm going to write out tasks and stuff
in the list below and we can work together on completing them. I'm going to put mockups I make in
a folder called "design" so we have them as reference Also, if you have any private repositories available, can
you make this one private?

1. If you want to claim a task, maybe add your name next to it like so? **Sachin**
1. ~~And once you finish a task, just cross it out.~~

### Tasks

1.  ~~Copy template off of this site [magnetic](https://pixelarity.com/magnetic). **Sachin**~~
2.  Split up template into smaller files for Jeyll
    - ~~partially done **Sachin**~~
    - need to create post and page layouts
3.  Fix background scrolling implementation (it's laggy)
3.  Recreate website layout (about page, team page, etc)
    - use Bryan's image for now, I can make something a little more concrete if needed
4.  ~~Connect with Google Drive so that others can edit content. **Sachin** ~~
    - this will be available at admin.mochillaadventures.com. Instructions coming soon.
5.  Get rest of team to add text content
6.  Create custom interactive blog/gallery based on designs
7.  Set up pipeline for new images, videos and blog content
7.  ???
