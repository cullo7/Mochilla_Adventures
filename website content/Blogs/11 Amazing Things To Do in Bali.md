**11 amazing things to do in Bali **

Bali is one of my favorite islands in South-East Asia. I spent the final

1.  Hike Mount Agung to see the Sunrise

        dream team because you will need it to conquer Mount Agung. Once

        them in a scooter is very relaxing and soothing. You can also
        snap some really good shots while you are exploring the green
        paddies. So don
