**11 amazing things to do in Bali **

Bali is one of my favorite islands in South-East Asia. I spent the final
6 weeks of my travels in Bali. After having spent 3 months moving around
from one city to another, I was tired and wanted to take some time to
settle down and reflect upon my travels. Bali was the perfect island to
do just that. Here are some of the most memorable things I did and
recommend to do if you are ever on this wonderful island.

1.  Hike Mount Agung to see the Sunrise

    a.  More like Mount Agony. It is one of the highest peaks in the
        world and it takes 7 hours of intense hiking to reach the summit
        for the sunrise. It is a very steep, dangerous and challenging
        climb. However, having a good supportive team and determination
        is what will get you to the top. So bring your willpower and
        dream team because you will need it to conquer Mount Agung. Once
        you make it to the top, you will see why the agony is all worth
        it.

    b.  This was one of the best highlights of my travels. Check out our
        *ignorance is bliss post* for a full description of the hike.

    c.  **p.s** - You will need a good Balinese massage after the hike.

2.  Rent a scooter and cruise through the rice paddies

    a.  Beautiful rice paddies are everywhere in Bali and driving around
        them in a scooter is very relaxing and soothing. You can also
        snap some really good shots while you are exploring the green
        paddies. So don’t forget to bring a camera.

3.  Hit up the beach

    a.  Bali has some of the best beaches in the world. In Canggu, you
        can enjoy a coconut while watching a beautiful sunset on the
        black sand beach. In Sanur, you can relax and meditate while
        watching the sunrise. You can literally find any kind of beach
        you want. And it’s free.

4.  Watch the spectacular sunsets

    a.  When it comes to sunsets, there is no place better than Bali.
        The sunsets in Bali are just beautiful and unforgettable. You
        will never be disappointed. Try and watch as many sunsets as
        possible while you are in Bali because you will miss them once
        you leave.

        stay together.’’ **

5.  Get a Balinese Massage

    a.  Getting a massage in Bali is a must. I got a full body massage
        after I hiked Mount Agung. My body was sore and achy and I
        desperately need one. The massage fixed this and all my life
        problems during that hour.

    b.  I paid \$5 dollars for the massage, however, prices vary and
        range from anywhere between 50-100k Rupiah (\$4-\$8 U.S
        dollars).

6.  Buy traditional wear and dress like a local.

    a.  When in Bali, do as the Balinese do. After seeing Balinese men
        dressed up in their traditional saput and sarong (hat and
        garment), I knew had to get my own because I love colorful stuff
        and the sarongs looked super comfortable. So I bought myself two
        sarongs and rocked them throughout my time in Bali.

    b.  You can purchase a sarong at any local clothing store or by the
        beach. Prices range anywhere from 35-100k Rupiah (\$3-\$8 U.S
        dollars) depending on your negotiation skills. You have to put
        those negotiation skills to use if you want to look and feel
        good.

    c.  **p.s** Sarongs also come in handy when you visit a Hindu temple
        as you have to cover-up your legs before entering. Definitely a
        good idea to buy one if you plan on visiting a temple

7.  Try surfing

    a.  Bali is known as the surfer’s island. Most surfers traveling
        around South-east Asia stop by Bali as the waves are perfect for
        surfing. There are many places that offer surf lessons right on
        the beach or you can just rent out a board. Being broke and
        being a rookie, I rented out a board for an hour and asked a
        friend for a short lesson. I set off tried getting up failed
        before I had to give back my

    b.  Here is some good advice from a foolish rookie- ‘’Renting out a
        board and a short 10 minute lessons won’t cut it. Take the
        lessons. And practice over and over again.

    c.  Check out my ‘’don’t always be foolish and cheap blog on surfing
        and other things’’

8.  Try Yoga and relax the body, mind and spirit.

    a.  Bali is the best place to be for Yoga. There are literally Yoga
        retreat places on every street corner or beach offering all
        different types of yoga.

    b.  I was lucky that I met two awesome friends at a hostel who had
        just received their Yoga teaching certifications in Bali and
        they were offering free Vinyasa yoga lessons. I quickly jumped
        on that and loved the Vinyasa flow.

9.  Get up early to see the sunrise

    a.  Sunrises in Bali are not too shabby either. You can catch some
        amazing sunrises in Sanur. They are even better when you go with
        friends.

    b.  **p.s** Watch out for the stray dogs in the early morning. They
        might terrorize you on your way to watch the sunrise. I am
        scared of dogs so take my advice with a grain of salt.

10. Get a palm reading

    a.  Why not? Whether you believe in them or not, palm readings are
        fun and interesting.

11. Celebrate Christmas in Bali

    a.  This was my second Christmas on the road and it was simply
        amazing. I celebrated Christmas with an amazing family and
        friends that I met in Bali. We went to the beach in the morning
        and then had a potluck Christmas celebration at the Unstoppable
        Family’s house. As you can see from the picture, it was lit and
        we even did the mannequin challenge to top it off.

    b.  If you are not lucky enough to meet an amazing family that would
        just invite you over for a big Christmas celebration. No
        worries, you and your friends can hit up a Christmas party on
        the beach.
